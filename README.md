The combination of animated object and enviroment map causes a large load time and lag so rendering them at different times could be better.

Animated Object:

For the animated object in the main.py file uncomment lines 206-213, lines 279 - 280 and in the scene.py file uncomment line 160.

You will need to also disable the standin dinosaur model which in the main.py file is lines 197-198 and line 274.

Enviroment map:

To enable to enviroment mapped object in the main.py file uncomment lines 184-189 and lines 263-270
